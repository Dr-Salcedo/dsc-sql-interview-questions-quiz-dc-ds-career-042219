    "## SQL Interview Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "This quiz contains questions on topics you can expect to see in an interview pertaining to SQL and Relational Databases. Some of them are multiple choice, while some are short answer. For these short answer questions, double click on the Jupyter Notebook and type your answer below the line. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "what are the 4 main datatypes in SQLite3? Can we use other common types from other kinds of SQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "INTEGER, a positive or negative whole number\n",
    "TEXT, a text string\n",
    "DATE, the date formatted as YYYY-MM-DD for the year, month, and day\n",
    "REAL, a decimal value \n",
    "\n",
    "Yes\n",
    "SQL data types can be broadly divided into following categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numeric data types such as int, tinyint, bigint, float, real etc.\n",
    "Date and Time data types such as Date, Time, Datetime etc.\n",
    "Character and String data types such as char, varchar, text etc.\n",
    "Unicode character string data types, for example nchar, nvarchar, ntext etc.\n",
    "Binary data types such as binary, varbinary etc.\n",
    "Miscellaneous data types – clob, blob, xml, cursor, table etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between **Primary Keys** and **Foreign Keys**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary key is unique to the table in question and a foregin key in said table is the primary key of another table in the relational database.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the different types of relationships entities can have in a SQL database. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "There are three types of relationships:\n",
    "\n",
    "One-to-one: Both tables can have only one record on either side of the relationship. Each primary key value relates to only one (or no) record in the related table. They're like spouses—you may or may not be married, but if you are, both you and your spouse have only one spouse. Most one-to-one relationships are forced by business rules and don't flow naturally from the data. In the absence of such a rule, you can usually combine both tables into one table without breaking any normalization rules.\n",
    "One-to-many: The primary key table contains only one record that relates to none, one, or many records in the related table. This relationship is similar to the one between you and a parent. You have only one mother, but your mother may have several children.\n",
    "Many-to-many: Each record in both tables can relate to any number of records (or no records) in the other table. For instance, if you have several siblings, so do your siblings (have many siblings). Many-to-many relationships require a third table, known as an associate or linking table, because relational systems can't directly accommodate the relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the various types of JOINs possible with SQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four basic types of SQL joins: inner, left, right, and full. \n",
    "\n",
    "(INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables\n",
    "LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Return all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table\n",
    "RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Return all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table\n",
    "FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Return all records when there is a match in either left or right table\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between Aggregate functions and GROUP BY statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "When using aggregate functions or calculations performed on multiple rows of a table, GROUP BY is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 6\n",
    "\n",
    "What role do Associative Entities play (JOIN Tables) in many-to-many JOINs?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we practiced answering open-ended interview questions for SQL and Relational Databases. "
